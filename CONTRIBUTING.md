## üìê Rule Development Standards

### MDC File Requirements

All cursor rules must follow these standards:

#### 1. **Proper Metadata**
```yaml
---
description: Clear, concise description of the rule's purpose
globs: pattern/to/match/**/*.ext
alwaysApply: true/false
---
```

#### 2. **Clear Structure**
```markdown
# Rule Title

Brief description of what this rule does.

## When This Applies
- Specific conditions
- File types or patterns
- Development phases

## Guidelines
1. Numbered guidelines
2. Clear and actionable
3. Include examples

## Examples
Concrete examples of correct usage.

## Common Mistakes
What to avoid and why.
```

#### 3. **File Naming**
- Use kebab-case: `my-rule-name.mdc`
- Be descriptive but concise
- Include domain if applicable: `frontend-styling.mdc`

#### 4. **Scope Appropriateness**
- **Global rules** (`alwaysApply: true`): Apply to entire project
- **Domain rules** (`alwaysApply: false`): Apply to specific file patterns
- **Feature rules**: Apply to specific features or components
