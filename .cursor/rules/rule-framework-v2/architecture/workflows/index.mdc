# Workflows Architecture Index
**🔍 Fast Lookup - Workflow Domain Files**

## 🤖 AI Instructions
**When to use**: Navigate workflow architecture patterns - integration of architecture into epic planning and development processes
**How to use**: Scan table → identify workflow → apply integration patterns
**Context**: Database-style index for workflow architecture integration

## 📊 WORKFLOWS FILE INDEX

### 🔄 **PROCESS INTEGRATION** (Development Workflows)
| **File** | **When to Use** | **Line Count** | **Contains** |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| `epic-integration.mdc` | Epic planning with architecture | 400 lines | Architecture consultation in epic workflows |
| `development.mdc` | Development process integration | 300 lines | Architecture checkpoints in development phases |

## ⚡ **QUICK DECISION PATHS**

```
🎯 WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING?
