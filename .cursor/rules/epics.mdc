**Comprehensive Epics Plan** 
<!-- Stores instructions on how to use this doc.  AI should always follow it.  AI should never modify or extend this section.  EPIC RULES section is reserved for AI -->
Contains the fully planned list of all epics, its phases, steps that need to be completed. 
You are always to keep that list tracked and updated as work is completed. Make sure that epics ( large initiatives ) are properly grouped and follow this 

hierarchy:  EPIC GROUP ->  EPIC -> PHASE -> STEPS.   

EPIC GROUP:  If needed, groups similar type of epics, creation of grouping is done automatically by AI, when it makes sense. 
EPIC: Large collection of work to be completed ( Large collection of features )
PHASE: Milestone that breaks up an EPIC in smaller sections of work to be completed ( group of features )
STEP: Breaks up the phase into even smaller work that accomplishes a meaningful feature. ( single feature )

IMPORTANT: When user invokes @EPIC or @EPICS plan, you are only instructed to build out a comprehensive plan for those epics and track it in this doc. Never actually execute on that plan, that is reserved for our workflow_state.mdc

IMPORTANT: After succesful epic plan, you should offer user to execute that epic with our workflow process defined in workflow_state.mdc
