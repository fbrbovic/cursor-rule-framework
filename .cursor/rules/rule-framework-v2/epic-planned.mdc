## ðŸ“‹ Epic Activation Guidelines

### Activation Criteria
- **Capacity Available**: Maximum 3 active epics in epic-active.mdc
- **Dependencies Satisfied**: All prerequisite work completed
- **Architecture Alignment**: Epic validated against current architecture patterns
- **Resource Availability**: Development resources allocated and available

### Activation Process
1. **Epic Selection**: Choose highest priority epic meeting activation criteria
2. **Architecture Validation**: Verify alignment with current architecture patterns
3. **Dependency Check**: Confirm all dependencies satisfied or manageable
4. **Resource Allocation**: Ensure development capacity and expertise available
5. **Epic Transfer**: Move complete epic details to epic-active.mdc
6. **Registry Update**: Update epic status in epic-registry.mdc

### Planning Considerations
- **Epic Sequencing**: Consider dependencies and logical development order
- **Resource Planning**: Balance epic complexity with available development capacity
- **Architecture Evolution**: Plan epics to build upon and enhance existing architecture
- **Risk Management**: Identify and plan for potential blockers and dependencies

---

**Framework Notes**:
- All planned epics are technology-agnostic examples demonstrating framework capabilities
- Replace sample epics with actual project epics when implementing the framework
- Epic structure demonstrates proper phase organization, architecture impact, and quality standards
- Examples show different epic types: infrastructure, integration, and user-facing development
