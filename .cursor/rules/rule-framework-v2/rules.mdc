## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY GLOBAL RULES

### **1. Architecture Governance (CRITICAL)**
**Rule**: ALWAYS consult architecture files before making decisions
**Action**: Use `fetch_rules(['architecture'])` to validate alignment with existing patterns
**Exception**: None - ALL architectural decisions must validate against established patterns

### **2. Epic Step Stage Compliance (CRITICAL)** 
**Rule**: Follow BLUEPRINT â†’ CONSTRUCT â†’ VALIDATE stages for all epic step work
**Action**: Reference `epic-lifecycle-rules.mdc` for detailed step stage requirements
**Exception**: None - all epic development must follow step stage workflow

### **3. Epic Integration (REQUIRED)**
**Rule**: Link work to active epics when applicable using epic step identification
**Action**: Consult `epic-registry.mdc` for current epic discovery and `epics/[EPIC_NAME].mdc` for step details
**Exception**: Standalone work (no epic context) is allowed

### **4. Architecture File Size Limits (ENFORCED)**
**Rule**: Maximum 500 lines per architecture file, 300 lines for index files
**Action**: Split oversized files immediately using patterns in `architecture-lifecycle.mdc`
**Exception**: None - strictly enforced for AI accessibility

## ðŸ“‹ Development Checklist

Before starting any development work:
- [ ] **Architecture Validation**: Consult relevant architecture files
- [ ] **Epic Context**: Check epic registry and identify current epic step
- [ ] **Step Stage Planning**: Begin with BLUEPRINT stage for epic step work
- [ ] **File Organization**: Place rules in correct workspace directory

## ðŸ”— Quick Reference Links

**For Architecture Work**: â†’ `architecture/index.mdc` (master navigation)  
**For Epic Management**: â†’ `epic-lifecycle-rules.mdc` (step stages and lifecycle)  
**For Epic Discovery**: â†’ `epic-registry.mdc` (fast lookup and status)  
**For Individual Epic Details**: â†’ `epics/[EPIC_NAME].mdc` (specific epic requirements)  
**For File Maintenance**: â†’ `architecture-lifecycle.mdc` (organization standards)  
**For Stubborn Issues**: â†’ `fix-stubborn-issues.mdc` (systematic problem-solving - user invoked only)

**File Purpose**: Minimal essential global rules with references to v3.0 specialized implementations  
**Maintenance**: Keep under 100 lines - move detailed rules to specialized files
