**Epic Planning & Tracking System**
<!-- AI INSTRUCTIONS: Always follow these rules. Never modify this section. -->

**Purpose**: Plan and track large initiatives using the hierarchy: EPIC GROUP ‚Üí EPIC ‚Üí PHASE ‚Üí STEPS

**Hierarchy Definitions**:
- **EPIC GROUP**: Optional grouping of related epics
- **EPIC**: Large collection of features/capabilities  
- **PHASE**: Major milestone within an epic
- **STEP**: Individual feature within a phase

**AI Usage Rules**:
1. **Planning Only**: When user requests @EPIC or @EPICS, create comprehensive plans here
2. **No Execution**: Never execute epic work - that happens in workflow_state.mdc  
3. **Track Progress**: Update epic status as work completes via workflow system
4. **Offer Execution**: After successful epic planning, offer to execute via workflow process

**Context Limits**: Maximum 3 active epics to maintain AI effectiveness

**EPICS PLANS**
<!-- Stores and tracks the EPIC GROUP, EPIC, PHASE and STEP type of plans.  Only to be modified and used by an AI -->

## EPIC PORTFOLIO STATUS

### Current Portfolio Summary
- **Total Active Epics**: 0 (Max: 3)
- **Completed Epics**: 0
- **Blocked Epics**: 0
- **Last Updated**: [Date when portfolio was last updated]

### Portfolio Limits
**Max Active Epics**: 3 (to maintain AI context effectiveness)
**Auto-Archive**: Completed epics older than 6 months

### Epic Status Legend
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: All phases and steps finished
- üîÑ **IN_PROGRESS**: Currently being worked on
- ‚è≥ **PLANNED**: Planned but not yet started
- üö´ **BLOCKED**: Stopped due to dependencies or issues
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **PAUSED**: Temporarily suspended
- ‚ùå **CANCELLED**: No longer needed

## ACTIVE EPICS

<!-- Active epics will be listed here with progress tracking -->

*No active epics currently planned. Use @EPIC or @EPICS to create new epic plans.*

## EPIC PROGRESS TRACKING

<!-- This section tracks progress for each epic with detailed status -->

### Simplified Epic Template
```
### EPIC: [Epic Name]
**Status**: [PLANNED/IN_PROGRESS/BLOCKED/COMPLETED]
**Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]
**Started**: [Start date]
**Target Completion**: [Target date]

#### Goal
[Clear business objective and user value]

#### Success Criteria

#### PHASE 1: [Phase Name] - [STATUS_ICON] [STATUS]
**Goal**: [Phase objective and deliverables]

**Steps:**
1. **[Step Name]**: [What needs to be built/implemented]
   - Key requirements: [2-3 critical requirements]
   - Acceptance criteria: [What defines "done"]

#### Notes
- [Key decisions, scope changes, or important context]

*Progress tracking entries will appear here as epics are created and executed.*

## EPIC COMPLETION HISTORY

<!-- Recently completed epics (last 6 months) for reference -->
<!-- Epics older than 6 months should be removed to maintain context size -->

*No completed epics yet. Completed epics will be listed here with completion date and key outcomes.*

## EPIC REPORTING AND RETROSPECTIVES

### Epic Status Summary (Manual Count)
*Updated manually when reviewing epic portfolio*
- **Current Active Epics**: [Count from Active Epics section]
- **Total Completed Epics**: [Count from Completion History]
- **Last Portfolio Review**: [Date of last manual review]

### Epic Retrospective Template
*Used when completing epics to capture learnings*
```
## Epic Retrospective: [Epic Name]

### Epic Summary
- **Final Status**: [Completed/Cancelled with reason]
- **Key Phases Completed**: [List major phases finished]
- **Original vs Actual Scope**: [Any scope changes made]

### What Went Well
- [Positive aspects of the epic execution]

### What Could Be Improved
- [Areas for improvement in future epics]

### Lessons Learned
- [Key learnings to apply to future epics]

### Recommendations
- [Specific recommendations for future epic planning/execution]
```

### Epic Maintenance Checklist
*For occasional portfolio cleanup*
- [ ] Review active epic statuses and update if needed
- [ ] Check for epics that should be completed or cancelled
- [ ] Archive completed epics older than 6 months
- [ ] Ensure no more than 3 active epics
- [ ] Update portfolio summary counts

## EPIC MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES

### Epic State Management
**State Transitions**:
```
PLANNED ‚Üí IN_PROGRESS ‚Üí COMPLETED
    ‚Üì         ‚Üì            ‚Üë
 CANCELLED ‚Üê BLOCKED ‚Üê ‚îÄ ‚îÄ ‚îò
    ‚Üì         ‚Üì
 ARCHIVED ‚Üê PAUSED
```

### Update Guidelines
- **During Active Work**: Update epic status when AI works on related tasks
- **Phase Completion**: Mark phases as completed when all major steps are done
- **Epic Completion**: Move completed epics to history section
- **Context Management**: Archive epics older than 6 months

### Portfolio Management
- **Max Active Epics**: Keep only 2-3 active epics to maintain AI context effectiveness
- **New Epic Planning**: If at limit, complete or pause existing epics before adding new ones
- **Epic Focus**: Use workflow-state.mdc for detailed step execution, epics.mdc for high-level tracking

### Realistic Expectations
- Updates happen during AI interactions, not on schedule
- Focus on epic and phase progress, not granular step tracking
- Use external tools (Jira, GitHub Projects) for detailed project management

## EPIC PLANNING WORKSPACE

<!-- Temporary workspace for drafting new epics before they become active -->

*This section can be used for drafting and refining epic plans before moving them to the active section.*
