# Architecture Decisions Index
**🔍 Fast Lookup - Decisions Domain Files**

## 🤖 AI CONTEXT DESCRIPTION
**WHEN TO USE**: Navigate architectural decision files - ADR creation, decision review, and decision history management
**MANDATORY FOR**: Architectural decision documentation, ADR creation, decision review processes, and decision tracking
**PRIMARY FUNCTION**: Provide database-style index for architectural decision documentation and management
**CRITICAL**: Ensures proper architectural decision documentation and prevents duplicate or conflicting decisions

## 📊 DECISIONS FILE INDEX

### 📋 **DECISION DOCUMENTATION** (Management)
| **File** | **When to Use** | **Line Count** | **Contains** |
|----|-----|----|----- |
| `adr-template.mdc` | Creating new ADRs | 78 lines | ADR structure, decision format, documentation standards |
| `sample-decisions.mdc` | Reviewing decision examples | 156 lines | Sample architectural decisions, decision patterns |

## ⚡ **QUICK DECISION PATHS**

```
🎯 WHAT DECISION WORK ARE YOU DOING?

CREATING NEW ADR:
├─ sample-decisions.mdc (review decision patterns)
└─ adr-template.mdc (create new ADR)

REVIEWING ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS:
├─ sample-decisions.mdc (decision examples and patterns)
└─ project-specific decision files (your actual decisions)

UNDERSTANDING DECISION CONTEXT:
├─ sample-decisions.mdc (decision reasoning examples)
└─ adr-template.mdc (decision documentation format)

DECISION AUDIT/REVIEW:
├─ sample-decisions.mdc (decision tracking examples)
└─ project-specific files (comprehensive review)
```

## 🔗 **DECISION DEPENDENCIES**

**Core Architecture**: `../core/index.mdc` (Implementation context and patterns)  
**Workflow Integration**: `../workflows/index.mdc` (Decision integration with epic planning)  

## 📋 **DECISION MANAGEMENT CHECKLIST**

✅ Check existing decisions before making new ones  
✅ Use adr-template.mdc for proper ADR documentation  
✅ Reference sample-decisions.mdc for decision patterns  
✅ Update decision tracking when decisions change  
✅ Link decisions to relevant architecture patterns  

## 📝 **DECISION CREATION PROCESS**

### **1. Decision Identification**
- Identify architectural choice that needs documentation
- Assess impact scope and stakeholder involvement
- Determine decision urgency and timeline

### **2. Research and Analysis**
- Review existing decisions for precedent
- Analyze alternatives and trade-offs
- Gather stakeholder input and requirements

### **3. Decision Documentation**
- Use ADR template for consistent documentation
- Include context, alternatives, and consequences
- Document decision rationale and assumptions

### **4. Decision Review and Approval**
- Review with relevant stakeholders
- Validate against architectural principles
- Approve and communicate decision

### **5. Decision Implementation and Tracking**
- Update relevant architecture documentation
- Track implementation progress
- Monitor decision outcomes and impacts
