## ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites

**CRITICAL**: Before using the v2 workflow system, you must install the enhanced user rules template:

1. Open `.cursor/rules/rule-framework-v2/user-rules-template.mdc`
2. Copy the entire file content
3. In Cursor IDE: **Settings** ‚Üí **Features** ‚Üí **Rules for AI** ‚Üí **User Rules**
4. Paste the content into the User Rules field

**Without this setup, the v2 AI-driven workflow system will not function correctly.**

**v2 Workflow Advantage**: The enhanced workflow system provides comprehensive coordination between development phases, epic management, and architecture evolution, enabling efficient AI-assisted development that maintains consistency across complex multi-technology projects.

## ü§ñ Automatic Integration Rules

### **Architecture Integration**
The workflow system automatically integrates with your project architecture:

- **RULE_ARCHITECTURE_VALIDATE_01**: During Blueprint phase, validates planned changes against existing architecture
- **RULE_ARCHITECTURE_UPDATE_01**: During Construct phase, updates architecture.mdc with new patterns and decisions
- **Architecture Conflict Resolution**: Handles simultaneous AI/user updates with timestamp-based conflict resolution

### **Epic Integration**
The workflow system seamlessly integrates with epic planning:

- **RULE_EPIC_UPDATE_01**: Automatically updates epic progress when workflow completes epic-related tasks
- **Epic Context Loading**: Automatically includes epic requirements and acceptance criteria in Blueprint phase
- **Natural Language Processing**: Interprets user requests to identify epic context and set workflow accordingly

### **Integration Benefits**
- **Consistency**: All development work aligns with existing architecture
- **Traceability**: Epic progress is automatically tracked through workflow completion
- **Knowledge Capture**: Architectural decisions are documented as they're made
- **Conflict Prevention**: Clear protocols for simultaneous AI/user updates

## üîÑ Workflow State Management

### **State Tracking**
The workflow system tracks its current state in `workflow-state.mdc`:

```yaml
## State
Phase: BLUEPRINT | CONSTRUCT | VALIDATE
Status: READY | IN_PROGRESS | BLOCKED | COMPLETED
CurrentItem: [Current task or epic being worked on]
```

### **State Transitions**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Start] --> B[BLUEPRINT]
    B --> C{Plan Approved?}
    C -->|Yes| D[CONSTRUCT]
    C -->|No| B
    D --> E[VALIDATE]
    E --> F{Validation Passed?}
    F -->|Yes| G[COMPLETED]
    F -->|No| H{Major Issues?}
    H -->|Yes| B
    H -->|No| D
```

### **Phase Guidelines**

#### **When to Move Between Phases**
- **Blueprint ‚Üí Construct**: Plan is detailed, approved, and actionable
- **Construct ‚Üí Validate**: Implementation is complete per the plan
- **Validate ‚Üí Blueprint**: Major issues require re-planning
- **Validate ‚Üí Construct**: Minor fixes needed
- **Validate ‚Üí Complete**: All validation passes

#### **When to Return to Previous Phases**
- **Construct ‚Üí Blueprint**: Fundamental design issues discovered
- **Validate ‚Üí Construct**: Implementation bugs or missing features
- **Validate ‚Üí Blueprint**: Requirements or architecture need changes

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Usage

### **Starting a New Feature**
```bash
# 1. Set workflow to Blueprint phase
"Let's plan the user profile editing feature"

# AI enters Blueprint phase, analyzes requirements
# Creates detailed implementation plan
# Asks for approval before proceeding

# 2. Approve and move to Construct
"The plan looks good, please implement it"

# AI enters Construct phase
# Implements exactly what was planned
# Handles errors and edge cases

# 3. Automatic validation
# AI automatically moves to Validate phase
# Runs tests, checks quality, verifies functionality
```

### **Handling Interruptions**
```bash
# If work is interrupted, state is preserved
## State
Phase: CONSTRUCT
Status: IN_PROGRESS
CurrentItem: USER_PROFILE_EDITING_FEATURE

## Plan
[Detailed plan preserved]

## Log
[Progress log maintained]

# When resuming, AI knows exactly where it left off
```

### **Team Collaboration**
```bash
# Team member can see current state
## State  
Phase: VALIDATE
Status: READY
CurrentItem: PAYMENT_INTEGRATION

# Understanding what's happening and what's next
# Can provide input or take over seamlessly
```

## üö® Common Patterns and Solutions

### **Blueprint Phase Challenges**

#### **Unclear Requirements**

**Problem:** Vague or incomplete requirements  
**Solution:** AI asks clarifying questions

#### **User Request:**
```bash
"Add authentication to the app"
```

#### **AI Response:**
```bash
"I need more details about the user authentication:
- What authentication method? (email/password, OAuth, etc.)
- Do you need password reset functionality?
- Should users stay logged in between sessions?
- Any specific security requirements?"
```

#### **Large Feature Scope**

**Problem:** Feature too big for single implementation  
**Solution:** Break into smaller, manageable pieces

#### **User Request:**
```bash
"Build a complete e-commerce system with user accounts, product catalog, shopping cart, payment processing, and admin dashboard"
```

#### **AI Response:**
```bash
"This feature is quite large. I recommend breaking it into phases:
1. Basic login/logout (this sprint)
2. Password reset (next sprint)  
3. Social OAuth (future sprint)
4. Two-factor authentication (future sprint)"
```

### **Construct Phase Challenges**

#### **Plan Doesn't Match Reality**

**Problem:** Implementation reveals plan issues  
**Solution:** Document and return to Blueprint

#### **AI Response during Construct:**
```bash
"During implementation, I discovered the existing API doesn't support 
the planned authentication flow. I need to revise the plan to work 
with the current backend constraints."
```

#### **Unexpected Errors**

**Problem:** Technical issues during implementation  
**Solution:** Handle incrementally, document decisions

#### **AI Response during Construct:**
```bash
"Encountered TypeScript error with the Context pattern. 
Applying alternative approach using custom hook pattern 
as discussed in project patterns. Continuing with implementation."
```

### **Validate Phase Challenges**

#### **Tests Failing**

**Problem:** Tests don't pass after implementation  
**Solution:** Fix issues or return to appropriate phase

#### **AI Response during Validate:**
```bash
"Two tests are failing due to missing mock setup. 
Fixing the test configuration and updating mocks 
to match the new authentication flow."
```

#### **Performance Issues**

**Problem:** Feature works but has performance problems  
**Solution:** Optimize or plan performance improvements

#### **AI Response during Validate:**
```bash
"Feature functions correctly but causes re-renders. 
Adding useMemo optimization to the authentication context 
to prevent unnecessary component updates."
```

## üìà Advanced Workflow Patterns

### **Epic-Level Planning**
For large initiatives, workflow automatically integrates with epic planning:

```bash
# User requests epic work with natural language
User: "Start working on the login component from the user management epic"

# AI automatically:
1. Searches epics.mdc for matching epic and step
2. Sets workflow context with epic reference
3. Includes epic requirements during blueprint phase
4. Updates epic progress when workflow completes

# Epic-workflow integration is AI-driven:
Epic: User Management System
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 1: Authentication (AI manages workflow integration)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 2: User Profiles (AI tracks progress automatically)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 3: Admin Panel (AI updates epic status)
```

### **Iterative Development**
Use workflow phases for iterative improvement:

```bash
# Iteration 1: Basic functionality
Blueprint ‚Üí Construct ‚Üí Validate

# Iteration 2: Enhanced features  
Blueprint ‚Üí Construct ‚Üí Validate

# Iteration 3: Performance optimization
Blueprint ‚Üí Construct ‚Üí Validate
```

### **Team Workflows**
Coordinate team development with shared state:

```bash
# Developer A works on auth
Phase: CONSTRUCT
CurrentItem: USER_AUTHENTICATION

# Developer B plans next feature
Phase: BLUEPRINT  
CurrentItem: USER_PROFILE_MANAGEMENT

# Team sees coordinated progress
```

## üîß Configuration and Customization

### **Adapting Phases for Your Project**
```markdown
# Example: Modify for your specific needs
[PHASE: DESIGN] - UI/UX design phase
[PHASE: BLUEPRINT] - Technical planning  
[PHASE: CONSTRUCT] - Implementation
[PHASE: REVIEW] - Code review phase
[PHASE: VALIDATE] - Testing and QA
```
