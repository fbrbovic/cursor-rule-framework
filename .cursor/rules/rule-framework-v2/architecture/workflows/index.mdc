# Workflows Architecture Index
**🔍 Fast Lookup - Workflow Domain Files**

## 🤖 AI CONTEXT DESCRIPTION
**WHEN TO USE**: Navigate workflow architecture patterns - integration of architecture into epic planning and development processes
**MANDATORY FOR**: Epic planning with architecture integration, development process workflow patterns, and architecture checkpoint validation
**PRIMARY FUNCTION**: Provide database-style index for workflow architecture integration patterns
**CRITICAL**: Ensures proper integration of architecture validation and compliance throughout epic and development workflows

## 📊 WORKFLOWS FILE INDEX

### 🔄 **PROCESS INTEGRATION** (Development Workflows)
| **File** | **When to Use** | **Line Count** | **Contains** |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| `epic-integration.mdc` | Epic planning with architecture | 400 lines | Architecture consultation in epic workflows |
| `development.mdc` | Development process integration | 300 lines | Architecture checkpoints in development phases |

## ⚡ **QUICK DECISION PATHS**

```
🎯 WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING?

EPIC PLANNING:
└─ epic-integration.mdc (Architecture consultation patterns)

DEVELOPMENT PROCESS:
└─ development.mdc (Architecture validation checkpoints)

QUALITY ASSURANCE:
└─ development.mdc (Architecture compliance validation)
```
