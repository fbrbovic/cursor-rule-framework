# üìà Epic Planning Guide

This guide explains how to use the epic planning system for managing large initiatives with AI assistance in the Cursor Rule Framework.

## üéØ Overview

Epic planning provides a structured approach to breaking down large projects into manageable pieces that can be systematically executed using the workflow system. It bridges the gap between high-level project goals and day-to-day development tasks.

### **Key Constraints**
- **Maximum 3 Active Epics**: To maintain AI context effectiveness and prevent information overload
- **6-Month Auto-Archive**: Completed epics older than 6 months are removed to keep files manageable  
- **AI Memory Focus**: Epic plans serve as long-term AI memory for project context and requirements
- **Simplified Tracking**: Focus on epic/phase progress rather than granular project management

## üèóÔ∏è Epic Hierarchy
