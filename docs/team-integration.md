# üë• Team Integration Guide

This guide explains how to share and coordinate cursor rules across development teams for consistent AI-assisted development.

## üéØ Overview

Team integration with the Cursor Rule Framework is fundamentally about sharing rule files and establishing team conventions. Since cursor rules are just `.mdc` files that Cursor AI reads, team integration focuses on version control, rule coordination, and establishing shared conventions.

## üöÄ Getting Started with Team Rules

### **Repository Setup**

#### **Basic Team Structure**
```bash
# Standard team setup
.cursor/rules/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project-config.mdc          # Team project settings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workflow-state.mdc          # Individual workflow state  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ epics.mdc                   # Shared epic planning
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture.mdc            # Team architecture decisions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rules.mdc                   # Team-accumulated rules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend-rules.mdc          # Frontend team standards
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend-rules.mdc           # Backend team standards
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ team-conventions.mdc        # Team-specific conventions
```

#### **Version Control Strategy**
```bash
# What to track in Git
‚úÖ Track: All .mdc rule files
‚úÖ Track: Team conventions and standards
‚úÖ Track: Epic planning and architecture
‚ùå Don't track: Individual workflow-state.mdc (optional)
‚ùå Don't track: Personal rule experiments

# .gitignore recommendations
echo ".cursor/rules/personal-*.mdc" >> .gitignore
echo ".cursor/rules/.tmp*" >> .gitignore
```

### **Team Rule Coordination**

#### **Creating Team Standards**
```yaml
# .cursor/rules/team-conventions.mdc
---
description: Team-specific conventions and standards
globs: "**/*.*"
alwaysApply: true
---

# Team Development Conventions

## Team Information
**Team**: Frontend Development Team
**Members**: Alice, Bob, Carol, David
**Primary Stack**: React, TypeScript, Node.js
**Code Review**: Required for all changes

## Shared Rule Development
### Rule Creation Process
1. Discuss pattern in team meeting
2. One person drafts the rule
3. Team reviews in next meeting
4. Merge after team approval

### Rule Maintenance
- Monthly rule review sessions
- Update rules when technologies change
- Remove obsolete rules promptly
- Document rule changes in Git commits

## Communication Standards
### Workflow Updates
- Update your workflow-state.mdc for complex work
- Share your epic progress in standups
- Ask for help when blocked on patterns
- Document architectural decisions

### Knowledge Sharing
- Add useful patterns to rules.mdc
- Share learnings in team Slack/Discord
- Help onboard new team members

# Team Epic Planning

## Active Epics

### EPIC-001: User Authentication System
**Assigned**: Alice (Lead), Bob (Support)
**Status**: IN_PROGRESS
**Timeline**: Jan 15 - Feb 1

#### Completed Steps
- ‚úÖ Authentication context setup (Alice)
- ‚úÖ Login form component (Bob)

#### In Progress
- üîÑ Password reset flow (Alice)
- ‚è≥ Testing setup (Bob - starting tomorrow)

### EPIC-002: Dashboard Redesign  
**Assigned**: Carol (Lead), David (Support)
**Status**: BLUEPRINT
**Timeline**: Feb 1 - Feb 15

#### Planning Status
- üîÑ Requirements gathering (Carol)
- ‚è≥ Design system review (David - next week)
```

#### **Individual Workflow States**
Each team member maintains their own `workflow-state.mdc`:

```markdown
# Alice's workflow-state.mdc
## State
**Phase**: CONSTRUCT
**Status**: IN_PROGRESS
**CurrentItem**: Password Reset Flow (EPIC-001)

## Plan
1. Create password reset email template
2. Implement reset token validation
3. Build new password form
4. Add integration tests

## Log
- 2025-01-16 09:00: Started password reset implementation
- 2025-01-16 11:30: Email template completed
- 2025-01-16 14:00: Working on token validation
```

### **Rule Development Collaboration**

#### **Shared Rule Evolution**
```bash
# Team process for rule development
1. Developer notices recurring pattern
2. Proposes rule in team Slack/meeting
3. Team discusses and refines approach
4. One person creates draft rule
5. Team reviews via Git PR/meeting
6. Merge and announce to team
```

#### **Example Team Rule Creation**
```bash
# Alice in team Slack:
"I've noticed we're inconsistent with error handling in our React components. 
Should we create a rule for this?"

# Team discussion leads to:
# Bob creates error-handling-rules.mdc

# Carol reviews and suggests improvements
# David tests with current codebase

# Team approves and merges rule
```

## üé≠ Role-Based Usage Patterns

### **Team Lead Responsibilities**

#### **Rule Governance**
- Facilitate monthly rule review meetings
- Resolve conflicts between rules or team preferences
- Ensure new team members understand the rule system
- Coordinate with other teams on shared standards

#### **Team Coordination**
```bash
# Weekly team check-ins
"Let's review our epic progress and any rule issues:
- Alice: How's the auth epic going? Any rule gaps?
- Bob: Any patterns from testing work to capture?
- Carol: Dashboard design rules ready for team review?
- David: Any blockers or rule conflicts?"
```

### **Senior Developer Contributions**

#### **Pattern Recognition and Rule Creation**
- Identify recurring patterns that should become rules
- Draft complex rules that require architectural understanding
- Mentor junior developers on rule usage
- Lead rule review sessions

#### **Quality Standards**
```bash
# Senior developer creating architecture rule
"I notice we're making inconsistent API integration decisions. 
Let me draft a rule for our API client patterns that covers:
- Error handling strategies
- Retry logic
- Loading state management
- Cache invalidation"
```

### **Junior Developer Learning**

#### **Rule-Guided Development**
- Use existing rules to understand team patterns
- Ask questions about rule interpretation
- Contribute simple rules for patterns they discover
- Practice workflow discipline with team support

#### **Learning Process**
```bash
# Junior developer workflow
1. Check relevant rules before starting work
2. Follow team patterns from rules.mdc
3. Ask for help interpreting complex rules
4. Document new patterns they discover
5. Get rule contributions reviewed by seniors
```

## üìã Team Rule Organization

### **Multi-Team Rule Structure**

#### **Large Organization Pattern**
```bash
# Organization with multiple teams
.cursor/rules/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ org-standards.mdc           # Organization-wide standards
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend-team/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react-patterns.mdc      # React-specific rules
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui-standards.mdc        # UI/UX guidelines
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ testing-patterns.mdc    # Frontend testing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend-team/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api-standards.mdc       # API design rules
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database-patterns.mdc   # Database conventions
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ security-rules.mdc      # Security guidelines
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture.mdc        # Shared architecture
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ deployment.mdc          # Deployment standards
```

#### **Cross-Team Coordination**
```bash
# Monthly cross-team rule sync
1. Share new patterns across teams
2. Identify conflicting rules between teams
3. Coordinate on shared infrastructure rules
4. Plan organization-wide rule updates
```

### **Team Rule Specialization**

#### **Frontend Team Focus**
```yaml
# frontend-patterns.mdc
---
description: Frontend team React and TypeScript patterns
globs: "src/**/*.{tsx,jsx,ts}"
alwaysApply: false
---

# Frontend Development Patterns

## Component Standards
- All components use TypeScript interfaces
- Props interfaces named ComponentNameProps
- Use functional components with hooks
- Include loading and error states

## State Management
- Use React Context for app-wide state
- Use useState for component-local state
- Use React Query for server state
- Avoid prop drilling beyond 2 levels

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for component logic
- Integration tests for user workflows
- Mock external dependencies consistently
- Test accessibility with testing-library
```

#### **Backend Team Focus**
```yaml
# backend-patterns.mdc
---
description: Backend team API and service patterns
globs: "src/api/**/*.{ts,js}"
alwaysApply: false
---

# Backend Development Patterns

## API Design
- Use RESTful conventions consistently
- Include proper HTTP status codes
- Implement request validation with Zod
- Return consistent error response format

## Database Patterns
- Use Prisma for database operations
- Implement proper transaction handling
- Include database migrations for schema changes
- Use connection pooling for performance

## Security Standards
- Validate all inputs at API boundaries
- Use JWT for authentication
- Implement rate limiting on public endpoints
- Log security-relevant events
```
