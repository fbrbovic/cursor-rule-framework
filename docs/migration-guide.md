# 🔄 Migration Guide

This guide helps you adopt the Cursor Rule Framework in existing projects, transforming your current development workflow into an AI-driven, rule-based approach.

## 🎯 Migration Overview

Migrating to the Cursor Rule Framework involves:
- **Assessment**: Evaluating your current project structure and patterns
- **Planning**: Creating a migration strategy that works for your team
- **Implementation**: Gradually introducing framework components
- **Adoption**: Training your team and establishing new workflows

## 📋 Pre-Migration Assessment

### **1. Project Analysis**

#### **Codebase Assessment**
```bash
# Analyze your current project structure
find . -type f -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" | wc -l
find . -type f -name "*.py" | wc -l
find . -type f -name "*.java" | wc -l

# Identify existing patterns
ls -la src/                 # Frontend structure
ls -la api/ || ls -la backend/  # Backend structure
ls -la tests/ || ls -la __tests__/  # Testing structure

# Check existing documentation

## 🚀 Migration Strategies

### **Strategy 1: Gradual Integration (Recommended)**

#### **Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1)**
```bash
# Step 1: Install Cursor IDE and basic setup
# Download and install Cursor IDE
# Copy user rules template to Cursor settings

# Step 2: Create basic rule structure
mkdir -p .cursor/rules

# Copy framework foundation files
curl -o .cursor/rules/cursor-rules-management.mdc \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/cursor-rule-framework/main/templates/cursor-rules-management.mdc

curl -o .cursor/rules/project-config.mdc \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/cursor-rule-framework/main/templates/project-config.mdc

curl -o .cursor/rules/workflow-state.mdc \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/cursor-rule-framework/main/templates/workflow-state.mdc

curl -o .cursor/rules/epics.mdc \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/cursor-rule-framework/main/templates/epics.mdc

curl -o .cursor/rules/architecture.mdc \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/cursor-rule-framework/main/templates/architecture.mdc
```

#### **Phase 2: Project Configuration (Week 1-2)**
```bash
# Step 3: Customize project-config.mdc
# Update with your project's actual tech stack and goals

# Step 4: Document current architecture
# Use AI to help analyze and document existing patterns:
"Analyze our current project structure and document the architecture patterns in architecture.mdc"

# Step 5: Create technology-specific rules
# Choose rules based on your stack from framework examples
cp examples/frontend-react-typescript/.cursor/rules/react-patterns.mdc .cursor/rules/
# OR
cp examples/backend-api/.cursor/rules/api-patterns.mdc .cursor/rules/
```

#### **Phase 3: Workflow Introduction (Week 2-3)**
```bash
# Step 6: Start using workflow for new features
# Begin with small, non-critical features

# Example first workflow usage:
"Plan a small UI component update using the framework workflow"

# Step 7: Epic planning for current work
# Document current major initiatives as epics
"Convert our current feature roadmap into epic format in epics.mdc"
```

#### **Phase 4: Team Adoption (Week 3-4)**
```bash
# Step 8: Team training and onboarding
# Share framework basics with team
# Create team-specific rules and patterns

# Step 9: Establish review process
# Include rule compliance in code reviews
# Regular epic and architecture reviews
```

### **Strategy 2: Pilot Project Approach**

#### **Option for Large Teams/Complex Projects**
```bash
# Step 1: Choose pilot project
# Select a new feature or module for framework adoption
# Smaller scope, lower risk

# Step 2: Full framework implementation on pilot
# Complete setup with all framework components
# Document lessons learned

# Step 3: Gradual expansion
# Apply learnings to other projects/modules
# Scale successful patterns across organization
```

## 🛠️ Technical Migration Steps

### **1. Rule Creation from Existing Patterns**

#### **Extract Existing Patterns**
```bash
# Identify common patterns in your codebase
"Analyze our existing React components and create rules for the common patterns"

# Document API conventions
"Review our existing API endpoints and document the patterns in architecture.mdc"

# Extract testing patterns
"Analyze our test files and create rules for testing conventions"
```

#### **Create Domain-Specific Rules**
```yaml
# Example: Extract database patterns
---
description: Database access patterns using Prisma ORM
globs: "src/db/**/*.ts"
alwaysApply: true
---

# Database Access Patterns
Based on analysis of existing codebase:

## Repository Pattern
- All database access through repository classes
- Use dependency injection for repositories
- Include error handling for all database operations

## Query Patterns
- Use Prisma client for all database operations
- Include relations using `include` option
- Implement pagination for list queries

## Transaction Handling
- Use Prisma transactions for multi-table operations
- Include rollback logic for failed operations
```

### **2. Architecture Documentation**

#### **Document Current Architecture**
```bash
# Use AI to help document existing architecture
"Analyze our current project and populate architecture.mdc with our existing patterns and decisions"

# Include current technology decisions
"Document our technology stack choices and architectural decisions in ADR format"

# Map out current system components
"Create a high-level architecture overview of our current system"
```

### **3. Epic Planning for Existing Work**

#### **Convert Current Roadmap**
```bash
# Transform current roadmap into epic format
"Convert our Q1 roadmap into epic format with phases and steps"

# Document ongoing work as epics
"Create epics for our current active development initiatives"

# Plan migrations as epics
"Create an epic for migrating our authentication system to use modern patterns"
```

## 🚨 Common Migration Challenges

### **Challenge 1: Team Resistance to Change**

#### **Solutions**
```bash
# Start with volunteers
# Begin with team members interested in AI tools
# Let early adopters demonstrate benefits

# Show immediate value
# Focus on pain points framework solves
# Demonstrate time savings and consistency improvements

# Gradual adoption
# Don't force immediate full adoption
# Allow parallel workflows during transition
```

### **Challenge 2: Existing Code Inconsistencies**

#### **Solutions**
```bash
# Don't try to fix everything at once
# Focus on new code following patterns
# Plan refactoring as separate initiatives

# Use framework for refactoring
# Create epics for code modernization
# Use architecture documentation to guide improvements

# Document current state honestly
# Include existing patterns in architecture.mdc
# Plan evolution rather than revolution
```

### **Challenge 3: Complex Existing Architecture**

#### **Solutions**
```bash
# Document incrementally
# Start with high-level architecture overview
# Add detail as you work in different areas

# Use AI assistance
# Let AI help analyze and document existing patterns
# Validate AI analysis with team knowledge

# Focus on most important patterns first
# Document patterns used in active development
# Address legacy patterns as they're encountered
```

## 🎯 Migration Best Practices

### **1. Start Small and Iterate**
- Begin with non-critical features
- Learn and adapt before full adoption
- Regular retrospectives and improvements

### **2. Documentation-First Approach**

- Keep architecture.mdc current
- Use epics to plan migration work itself

### **3. Team-Centric Migration**
- Include entire team in planning
- Address concerns and resistance proactively
- Celebrate early wins and improvements

### **4. Continuous Improvement**
- Regular rule review and updates
- Epic retrospectives for lessons learned
- Architecture reviews for consistency

### **5. Measure and Validate**
- Track adoption metrics
- Gather team feedback regularly
- Adjust approach based on results
