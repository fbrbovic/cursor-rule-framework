# üë• For Teams: Collaborative Development Guide

How development teams can leverage the Cursor Rule Framework for enhanced collaboration, consistency, and productivity.

## üéØ Team Quick Start

### **Week 1: Foundation Setup**
```bash
# Team Lead Setup
# 1. Initialize framework in repository
mkdir -p .cursor/rules
git submodule add https://github.com/your-org/cursor-rule-framework .cursor/framework

# 2. Create core team rules
cp .cursor/framework/templates/* .cursor/rules/
# Customize for your team's tech stack and patterns

# 3. Team member onboarding
# Each developer installs Cursor IDE and user rules template
# Share onboarding checklist and framework introduction session
```

### **Week 2: Rule Development**
```bash
# Collaborative rule creation
# Team workshop: Identify existing patterns and pain points
# Create rules for most common development patterns
# Start with 3-5 core rules, not everything at once

# Example initial rules:
# - Component development standards
# - API endpoint patterns  
# - Testing requirements
# - Code review checklist
```

### **Week 3: Workflow Integration**
```bash
# Begin using workflow for all new features
# Assign workflow mentors for team members
# Establish epic planning for current sprint/roadmap
# Set up regular rule review meetings
```

### **Week 4: Team Adoption**
```bash
# Full team adoption
# Code reviews include rule compliance checks
# Epic planning becomes standard for large features
# Architecture documentation stays current automatically
# Regular retrospectives on framework effectiveness
```

## ü§ù Team Collaboration Patterns

### **Distributed Knowledge Management**

#### **Shared Rule Repository**
```bash
# All team rules in version control
.cursor/rules/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project-config.mdc       # Team-wide configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workflow-state.mdc       # Shared workflow state
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture.mdc         # Living architecture documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ epics.mdc               # Team epic planning

    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ git-workflow.mdc     # Team Git practices
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ documentation.mdc    # Documentation standards
```

#### **Knowledge Sharing Through Rules**
```bash
# Senior developers encode expertise in rules
"Create a rule for our established error handling pattern based on the payments service implementation"

# New team members learn through guided rule application
"Following our API patterns, implement the user preferences endpoint"

# Domain experts share specialized knowledge
"The security team has created new authentication rules - let's review and apply them"
```

### **Epic-Driven Team Planning**

#### **Collaborative Epic Creation**
```bash
# Product Manager + Team Lead
"Create an epic for the new user onboarding flow with 4 phases over 6 weeks"

# Team breakdown
"Break down the onboarding epic into specific development steps for the team"

# Cross-team coordination
"How does the onboarding epic connect with the analytics team's tracking epic?"
```

#### **Epic Assignment and Tracking**
```bash
# Epic ownership and delegation
"Assign the frontend components phase to Sarah and the API phase to Mike"

# Progress visibility
"Show team progress on all active epics for standup meeting"

# Dependency management
"The authentication epic is blocking the onboarding epic - what's the status?"
```

### **Architecture Evolution Management**

#### **Collaborative Architecture Decision Making**
```bash
# Architecture review sessions
"Review proposed changes to our API authentication architecture"

# Team consensus building
"The team has agreed to adopt the repository pattern - update architecture.mdc"

# Impact assessment
"How will the new microservice architecture affect our current epics?"
```

#### **Automatic Documentation Updates**
```bash
# Team members contribute through development
# AI automatically updates architecture.mdc during feature development
# Regular team reviews ensure accuracy and consensus
# Conflicts resolved through team discussion and decision-making
```

## üìã Team Workflow Management

### **Sprint Planning with Framework**

#### **Epic-to-Sprint Translation**
```bash
# Convert epic phases to sprint items
"Convert the user dashboard epic Phase 2 into sprint backlog items"

# Capacity planning with epic context
"Based on our current epic progress, what can the team realistically complete this sprint?"

# Cross-epic dependencies
"Identify dependencies between current epics that affect sprint planning"
```

#### **Story Refinement with Rules**
```bash
# Rule-aware story estimation
"Estimate the user profile component story using our established React patterns"

# Acceptance criteria alignment
"Ensure this API story includes all requirements from our validation rules"

# Definition of done with framework
"Review definition of done against our workflow validation requirements"
```

### **Daily Standups Enhanced**

#### **Framework-Aware Status Updates**
```bash
# Epic progress integration
"I completed the login component from the authentication epic - 75% done with Phase 1"

# Workflow state awareness
"Currently in Construct phase for the payment processing feature"

# Architecture impact communication
"The new caching layer I'm adding will affect our data access patterns"
```

#### **Blocker Resolution with Context**
```bash
# Rule-related blockers
"Stuck on implementing the new validation pattern - need team input"

# Epic dependency blockers
"Can't proceed with user dashboard until authentication epic Phase 1 is complete"

# Architecture decision blockers
"Need team decision on database schema changes before continuing"
```

### **Code Review Excellence**

#### **Rule-Driven Code Reviews**
```bash
# Automated rule compliance checking
"Review this PR against our established React component patterns"

# Architecture consistency validation
"Does this API change align with our documented architecture patterns?"

# Epic context validation
"Verify this implementation matches the epic requirements and acceptance criteria"
```

#### **Knowledge Transfer Through Reviews**
```bash
# Learning opportunities
"This PR introduces a new testing pattern - should we add it to our rules?"

# Pattern evolution
"This optimization could become our new standard approach - let's discuss"

# Cross-team knowledge sharing
"The backend team's new error handling pattern could benefit frontend too"
```

## üéì Team Learning and Development

### **Onboarding New Team Members**

#### **Accelerated Context Building**
```bash
# Day 1: Framework introduction
# New developer installs Cursor IDE and user rules template
# Walkthrough of team's rule repository and architecture documentation

# Week 1: Guided development
# Work on small features with framework workflow
# Pair programming with framework-experienced team members
# Review active epics to understand current team priorities

# Week 2: Independent feature work
# Take ownership of epic steps with mentor support
# Contribute to rule improvements based on fresh perspective
# Participate in architecture discussions and decision-making
```

#### **Structured Learning Path**

```

### **Continuous Team Learning**

#### **Pattern Discovery Workshops**
```bash
# Monthly pattern workshops
# Team identifies new patterns emerging in codebase
# Collaborative rule creation and improvement sessions
# Architecture evolution planning and discussion

# Example workshop:
"Let's review the user interface patterns we've developed over the last month"
"Should these become standardized rules for the team?"
"How do these patterns fit into our overall architecture?"
```

#### **Cross-Team Knowledge Sharing**
```bash
# Inter-team epic collaboration
"The payments team's new validation patterns could improve our user registration flow"

# Architecture alignment sessions
"How does our team's authentication approach align with the mobile team's requirements?"

# Rule standardization across teams
"Can we standardize API error handling patterns across all teams?"
```

## üîß Team Customization Strategies

### **Team-Specific Rule Development**

#### **Technology Stack Rules**
```yaml
---
description: "Team's full-stack TypeScript development standards"
alwaysApply: true
priority: 3
tags: ["team", "typescript", "standards"]
---

# Team Full-Stack Standards

## Technology Decisions
- Frontend: React 18 with TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js with Express and TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Testing: Jest + React Testing Library + Supertest
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with CSS Modules for components

## Team Conventions
- All new code must be TypeScript
- Components require prop interfaces and tests
- API endpoints require Zod validation and OpenAPI docs
- Database changes require migrations and rollback plans
- All features require epic context and architecture review
```

#### **Team Workflow Customization**
```yaml
