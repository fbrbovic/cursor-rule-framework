# üìà Epic Planning Guide

This guide explains how to use the epic planning system for managing large initiatives with AI assistance in the Cursor Rule Framework.

## üéØ Overview

Epic planning provides a structured approach to breaking down large projects into manageable pieces that can be systematically executed using the workflow system. It bridges the gap between high-level project goals and day-to-day development tasks.

## üèóÔ∏è Epic Hierarchy

### **Four-Level Structure**

```
EPIC GROUP (Optional)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EPIC (Large Initiative)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PHASE (Milestone)
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ STEP (Feature)
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TASK (Implementation)
```

#### **Epic Group** (Optional)
- **Purpose**: Groups related epics for very large projects
- **Scope**: Multiple months to years
- **Example**: "Platform Modernization", "User Experience Overhaul"

#### **Epic** (Required)
- **Purpose**: Large collection of work with clear business value
- **Scope**: 1-3 months of development
- **Example**: "User Authentication System", "Payment Processing"

#### **Phase** (Required)
- **Purpose**: Milestone that groups related features
- **Scope**: 1-4 weeks of development
- **Example**: "Basic Authentication", "Advanced Security Features"

#### **Step** (Required)
- **Purpose**: Single feature or component
- **Scope**: 1-5 days of development
- **Example**: "Login Component", "Password Reset Flow"

## üìã Epic Planning Process

### **1. Epic Creation**
```bash
# User initiates epic planning
"I need to plan a user management system for our application"

# AI responds with epic planning
"I'll help you create a comprehensive epic plan for user management. Let me break this down systematically."
```

### **2. Epic Structure Definition**
```markdown
## EPIC: User Management System

### Epic Goals
- Implement comprehensive user authentication
- Enable user profile management
- Add role-based access control
- Provide admin user management tools

### Success Criteria
- Users can register, login, and manage profiles
- Admins can manage user accounts and permissions
- Security standards are met (authentication, authorization)
- System scales to 10,000+ users

### Dependencies
- Database design completed
- UI component library available
- Authentication service selected
```

### **3. Phase Breakdown**
```markdown

```

### **4. Step Detailing**
```markdown
#### STEP: User Registration Component

**Acceptance Criteria:**

```

## üîÑ Epic Execution

### **Integration with Workflow System**
Each step follows the three-phase workflow:

```bash
# Step execution follows workflow
STEP: User Registration Component
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BLUEPRINT: Plan component architecture
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CONSTRUCT: Implement component
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ VALIDATE: Test and verify functionality

# Multiple steps per phase
PHASE: Core Authentication
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ STEP 1: Registration (Blueprint ‚Üí Construct ‚Üí Validate)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ STEP 2: Login (Blueprint ‚Üí Construct ‚Üí Validate)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ STEP 3: Password Reset (Blueprint ‚Üí Construct ‚Üí Validate)
```

### **Progress Tracking**

## üìà Advanced Epic Patterns

### **Cross-Team Epics**
```markdown
## EPIC: Mobile App Launch
**Teams**: Frontend, Backend, Mobile, QA, DevOps

### PHASE 1: Foundation (All Teams)
- Backend: API development
- Frontend: Admin dashboard
- Mobile: Core app structure
- DevOps: Infrastructure setup

### PHASE 2: Integration (Cross-Team)
- API integration testing
- End-to-end workflow validation
- Performance optimization
```

### **Dependent Epics**
```markdown
## Epic Dependencies
EPIC A: User Authentication
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Blocks: EPIC B (User Profiles)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Blocks: EPIC C (Admin Dashboard)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Enables: EPIC D (Social Features)

## Dependency Management
- Track blocking relationships
- Plan epic sequencing
- Identify parallel work opportunities
```

### **Epic Refinement**
```bash
# Regular epic review process
1. Weekly epic review meetings
2. Progress assessment and blockers
3. Scope adjustments as needed
4. Resource reallocation
5. Timeline updates
```

## üéØ Epic Planning Best Practices

### **Effective Epic Definition**
- **Clear Business Value**: Every epic should deliver measurable business value
- **User-Centric**: Frame epics in terms of user benefits
- **Time-Boxed**: Set realistic timelines with buffer
- **Testable**: Define clear acceptance criteria

### **Appropriate Scope**
```bash
# ‚úÖ Good Epic Scope
EPIC: User Authentication System
- Clear boundaries and deliverables
- 1-3 months of work
- Single team ownership
- Measurable outcomes

# ‚ùå Poor Epic Scope  
EPIC: Improve the Application
- Vague and unbounded
- No clear deliverables
- Multiple teams affected
- Unmeasurable success
```

### **Step Sizing**
```bash
# ‚úÖ Good Step Size
STEP: Login Component
- 1-3 days of work
- Single developer ownership
- Clear deliverable
- Testable outcome

# ‚ùå Poor Step Size
STEP: Implement Authentication
- Weeks of work
- Multiple developers needed
- Vague deliverable
- Hard to test completion
```

## üîÑ Epic Lifecycle Management

### **Epic States**
```bash
PLANNED     ‚Üí ACTIVE ‚Üí BLOCKED ‚Üí ACTIVE ‚Üí COMPLETED
               ‚Üì         ‚Üë         ‚Üì
            PAUSED ‚Üê‚Üí CANCELLED ‚Üê‚Üí ARCHIVED
```

### **State Transitions**
- **PLANNED ‚Üí ACTIVE**: Epic work begins
- **ACTIVE ‚Üí BLOCKED**: Dependencies or issues prevent progress
- **BLOCKED ‚Üí ACTIVE**: Blockers resolved, work resumes
- **ACTIVE ‚Üí PAUSED**: Temporary suspension (resource reallocation)
- **ACTIVE ‚Üí COMPLETED**: All phases and steps finished
- **ANY ‚Üí CANCELLED**: Epic no longer needed
- **COMPLETED ‚Üí ARCHIVED**: Epic archived for reference

### **Epic Review Cadence**
```bash
# Daily: Step-level progress (via workflow system)
# Weekly: Phase-level review and planning
# Monthly: Epic-level assessment and adjustment
# Quarterly: Epic portfolio review
```

## üö® Common Epic Challenges

### **Scope Creep**
```bash
# Problem: Epic grows beyond original scope
# Solution: Strict change management

"New requirements for the user management epic. 
Should we:
1. Add to current epic (extends timeline)
2. Create new epic for additional features
3. Move to backlog for future consideration"
```

### **Epic Stalling**
```bash
# Problem: Epic progress stops
# Root causes and solutions:

1. **Dependencies**: Resolve blocking issues
2. **Resources**: Reallocate team members
3. **Complexity**: Break down further
4. **Priorities**: Re-evaluate epic importance
```

### **Epic Coordination**
```bash
# Problem: Multiple teams working on related epics
# Solution: Cross-epic coordination

"Detected overlap between User Management and Admin Dashboard epics.
Recommend:
1. Shared component library
2. Coordinated API design
3. Joint testing strategy"
```

## üìä Epic Metrics and Reporting

### **Progress Metrics**
```bash
# Epic Completion Rate
- Steps completed vs. planned
- Phase completion timeline
- Epic velocity trends

# Quality Metrics  
- Defect rate per step
- Rework percentage
- User acceptance rates

# Efficiency Metrics
- Actual vs. estimated effort
- Resource utilization
- Dependency resolution time
```

### **Epic Reporting**
```markdown
## Weekly Epic Report

### Active Epics (3)
1. **User Management** - 60% complete, on track
2. **Payment Integration** - 30% complete, blocked (API access)
3. **Mobile App** - 85% complete, ahead of schedule

### Completed This Week
- User Registration component (User Management)
- Payment form validation (Payment Integration)

### Upcoming Milestones
- User Profile editing (due next week)
- Payment processing integration (pending API access)
- Mobile app beta release (next month)

### Risks and Issues
- Payment API access delayed - impact to Phase 2 timeline
- Mobile team resource constraint - considering external help
```
