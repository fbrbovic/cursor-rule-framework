# ADR Template - Architectural Decision Record

## ü§ñ AI Instructions
**When to use**: Creating new architectural decision records (ADRs) for any significant architectural choice
**How to use**: Copy this template, fill in all sections, and save as new ADR file
**Context**: Standardized format for documenting architectural decisions with rationale and consequences

## üìã ADR Template Structure

### **ADR-[NUMBER]: [DECISION TITLE]**
**Status**: [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]  
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Deciders**: [List of people involved in decision]  
**Technical Story**: [Brief description or ticket reference]

---

### **Context**
[Describe the context and problem statement that led to this decision. Include any relevant background information, constraints, or requirements that influenced the decision.]

### **Decision**
[State the architectural decision that was made. Be specific and clear about what was chosen.]

### **Rationale**
[Explain why this decision was made. Include the reasoning, analysis, and factors that led to this choice.]

### **Alternatives Considered**
[List and briefly describe the alternative options that were considered but not chosen.]

#### **Alternative 1: [Name]**
- **Description**: [Brief description]
- **Pros**: [Benefits of this alternative]
- **Cons**: [Drawbacks or limitations]
- **Why not chosen**: [Specific reasons for rejection]

#### **Alternative 2: [Name]**
- **Description**: [Brief description]
- **Pros**: [Benefits of this alternative]
- **Cons**: [Drawbacks or limitations]
- **Why not chosen**: [Specific reasons for rejection]

### **Consequences**
[Describe the positive and negative consequences of this decision.]

#### **Positive Consequences**
- [List positive outcomes and benefits]
- [Include performance, maintainability, and development impacts]

#### **Negative Consequences**
- [List drawbacks, limitations, or risks]
- [Include technical debt or future constraints]

#### **Neutral Consequences**
- [List consequences that are neither clearly positive nor negative]

### **Implementation**
[Describe how this decision will be implemented.]

#### **Implementation Steps**
1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [Additional steps as needed]

#### **Timeline**
- **Start Date**: [When implementation begins]
- **Target Completion**: [When implementation should be complete]
- **Milestones**: [Key milestones during implementation]

### **Validation**
[Describe how the success of this decision will be measured.]

#### **Success Criteria**
- [Measurable criteria for success]
- [Performance metrics or quality indicators]

#### **Monitoring**
- [How the decision outcomes will be monitored]
- [What metrics will be tracked]

### **Related Decisions**
[List related ADRs or decisions that are connected to this one.]
- **ADR-[NUMBER]**: [Brief description of relationship]
- **Related Architecture**: [Links to relevant architecture documentation]

### **Notes**
[Any additional notes, assumptions, or context that doesn't fit in other sections.]

## üìù ADR Creation Guidelines

### **When to Create an ADR**
- Significant architectural choices that affect multiple components
- Technology selection decisions
- Design pattern or architectural style choices
- Infrastructure or deployment decisions
- Security architecture decisions
- Performance or scalability decisions

### **ADR Numbering**
- Use sequential numbering: ADR-001, ADR-002, etc.
- Maintain consistent numbering across all project ADRs
- Include the number in the filename: `adr-001-decision-title.mdc`

### **Decision Status Lifecycle**
1. **Proposed**: Decision is under consideration
2. **Accepted**: Decision has been approved and is being implemented
3. **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer recommended but still in use
4. **Superseded**: Decision has been replaced by a newer decision

### **Writing Best Practices**
- Be concise but comprehensive
- Use clear, non-technical language when possible
- Include diagrams or examples when helpful
- Focus on the "why" not just the "what"
- Consider future readers who weren't involved in the decision

### **Review Process**
1. Create ADR in "Proposed" status
2. Share with relevant stakeholders for review
3. Address feedback and update ADR
4. Change status to "Accepted" when approved
5. Update related documentation and architecture files
