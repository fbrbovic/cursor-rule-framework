# üë®‚Äçüíª For Developers: Individual Workflow Guide

How to leverage the Cursor Rule Framework for enhanced individual development productivity.

## üéØ Quick Start for Developers

### **Day 1: Basic Setup (10 minutes)**

#### **Setup Steps:**
1. Install Cursor IDE if not already installed
2. Copy user rules template to Cursor settings
3. Clone/setup your project with framework rules

#### **Quick Verification:**

**User Request:**
```bash
"What rules apply to this file?"
```

**Expected AI Response:**
```bash
"This TypeScript React component file has the following rules active:
- Component Development Standards (naming, structure, accessibility)
- TypeScript Standards (interfaces, type safety)
- Testing Requirements (unit tests, accessibility tests)
- Styling Standards (Tailwind CSS patterns)"
```

### **Week 1: Learning the Workflow**

Practice the three-phase workflow on small tasks:

#### **User Request:**
```bash
"Enter Blueprint phase: Create a UserProfile component with props for user data and edit callback"
```

#### **AI Response:**
```bash
"I'll start the Blueprint phase for the UserProfile component. Let me plan the component structure and review our established patterns."

# AI will:
# ‚úÖ Plan the component structure
# ‚úÖ Review architecture patterns
# ‚úÖ Create detailed implementation plan
# ‚úÖ Set workflow state to BLUEPRINT
```

#### **Continue to Implementation:**

**User Request:**
```bash
"Proceed to Construct phase"
```

**AI Response:**
```bash
"Moving to Construct phase. I'll implement the UserProfile component according to the approved plan."
# AI implements according to plan
```

#### **Final Validation:**

**User Request:**
```bash
"Proceed to Validate phase"
```

**AI Response:**
```bash
"Entering Validate phase. I'll test the component and verify it meets all requirements."
# AI tests and validates the implementation
```

### **Week 2: Epic Integration**

Start working with epics for larger features:

#### **Create New Epic:**

**User Request:**
```bash
"Create a new epic for implementing user authentication with JWT"
```

**AI Response:**
```bash
"I'll create a comprehensive user authentication epic with JWT implementation. Let me structure this into phases covering registration, login, token management, and security features."
```

#### **Work on Epic Steps:**

**User Request:**
```bash
"Work on the login component from the user authentication epic"
```

**AI Response:**
```bash
"I'll start working on the login component from the User Authentication Epic, Phase 1: Core Authentication. Let me begin with the Blueprint phase to plan the implementation."

# AI will:
# ‚úÖ Reference epic context and requirements
# ‚úÖ Apply relevant rules for authentication
# ‚úÖ Update epic progress automatically
```

## üíª Daily Development Workflow

## üõ†Ô∏è Personal Productivity Tips

### **Contextual Development**
```bash
# Always provide context for better assistance
"Working on the checkout flow epic, implement payment validation"

# Instead of:
"Implement payment validation"

# AI uses epic context for:
# ‚úÖ Consistent patterns within the epic
# ‚úÖ Relevant business requirements
# ‚úÖ Architecture decisions for this feature area
```

### **Rule-Aware Coding**
```bash
# Ask about applicable rules
"What rules apply to API endpoint development in this project?"

# Get pattern suggestions
"Show me the standard pattern for creating a new database model"

# Validate against rules
"Does this component follow our established React patterns?"
```

### **Architecture-Conscious Development**
```bash
# Check architectural impact
"How does adding this new service affect our current architecture?"

# Get guidance for complex decisions
"What's the recommended approach for handling user sessions in our architecture?"

# Document architectural changes
"This API change affects our authentication flow - update architecture documentation"
```

### **Epic Progress Management**
```bash
# Track your contribution to larger initiatives
"Update my progress on the user management epic"

# See the bigger picture
"Show me how my current work fits into the overall epic goals"

# Plan next steps
"What should I work on next for the user management epic?"
```

## üìà Skill Development

### **Learning Project Patterns**
```bash
# Understand established patterns
"Explain the authentication pattern used in this project"

# Learn from examples
"Show me examples of how we handle API errors in this codebase"

# Get pattern variations
"What are different ways to implement state management following our rules?"
```

### **Best Practice Adoption**
```bash
# Learn why patterns exist
"Why do our rules require TypeScript interfaces for all React props?"

# Understand trade-offs
"What are the benefits and drawbacks of our current database access pattern?"

# See improvements over time
"How have our testing patterns evolved and why?"
```

### **Knowledge Building**
```bash
# Build understanding incrementally
"Explain how our API authentication works from the database to the frontend"

# Connect different parts of the system
"How does the user registration flow connect to our email service?"

# Learn architectural reasoning
"What architectural decisions led to our current microservice boundaries?"
```
