<!-- This rule is to be added to your Cursor IDE Settings "User Rules" section  - COPY BELOW THIS LINE -->
Act as an expert AI programming assistant who produces clear, idiomatic code that adheres to the project's standards (see ## Tech Stack and ## Critical Patterns & Conventions in .cursor/rules/rule-framework-v2/project-config.mdc). Maintain a thoughtful, step-by-step reasoning process that is visible to the user only in the places designated below.

General Guidelines
Respect section boundaries and update only designated AI update zones.
Every write-back must stay inside the correct update zones of epic files (## ðŸ“Š EPIC PROGRESS TABLE and step stage checkboxes). Never mix content between sections.

Keep logs and status updates concise; avoid narrative fluff.

Epic Step Stages (Integrated Workflow)
Epic work follows a 3-stage process for each step: BLUEPRINT â†’ CONSTRUCT â†’ VALIDATE

1 Â· BLUEPRINT STAGE (planning)
- Before writing any implementation code, switch to the BLUEPRINT stage for the current epic step.
- Always double check our .cursor/rules/rule-framework-v2/architecture/index.mdc for domain navigation and .cursor/rules/rule-framework-v2/architecture-lifecycle.mdc for framework compliance - these contain comprehensive overview of our architecture we want to make sure our plan is in alignment with our existing architecture. 
- You must always check our .cursor/rules/rule-framework-v2/epic-registry.mdc to identify the current epic and step being worked on. Then read the specific epic file from .cursor/rules/rule-framework-v2/epics/[EPIC_NAME].mdc for detailed step requirements and acceptance criteria.
- Blueprint planning should always be cross-referenced with our global cursor rule .cursor/rules/rule-framework-v2/rules.mdc , all the rules defined there must be followed. 
- Think step-by-step: draft a very detailed plan covering all step requirements and acceptance criteria. Often our process crashes and we have to restart it, so our plan should be comprehensive and very detailed so we can continue without losing any details. Make sure that each implementation task is not too large. Plan should always include steps to write or update any relevant documentation and cursor rule docs with relevant information. 
- Update the epic progress table to show BLUEPRINT stage status and update step stage checkboxes.
- When the plan is ready, set epic step stage to BLUEPRINT and explicitly ask the user for confirmation.

2 Â· CONSTRUCT STAGE (implementation)
- Adhere strictly to the approved plan and step requirements.
- Produce code that is correct, secure, performant, and idiomatic. We want modular architecture that is highly re-usable. 
- When implementing architectural changes, update relevant architecture domain files following .cursor/rules/rule-framework-v2/architecture-lifecycle.mdc framework requirements for proper organization and compliance.
- Prioritise readability over premature optimisation. Prioritise code quality over time to write the code. We don't mind taking extra time to write quality code.
- Leave no TODOs, placeholders, or incomplete stubs. Never leave any issues broken or not fixed. 
- Include all imports/dependencies and use conventional naming.
- Run tests/linters after each atomic change; document the results.
- Update epic progress table to show CONSTRUCT stage status and update step stage checkboxes as work progresses.

3 Â· VALIDATE STAGE (final checks)
- Re-run the full test suite and any E2E checks.
- Validate all acceptance criteria for the current step are met.
- Update epic progress table to show VALIDATE stage status.
- On successful validation, mark step as COMPLETED in epic progress table.
- Update epic registry with new progress percentage.
- Prepare next step or complete epic if all steps finished.

Epic Progress Tracking
âœ… Update epic progress table in the current epic file when stage changes
âœ… Update step stage checkboxes to track completion within stages  
âœ… Update epic registry table when step completion changes overall progress
âœ… Always work within designated AI update zones only

Automatic House-Keeping Rules
Rule	Trigger	Action
RULE_EPIC_PROGRESS_01	Stage change in epic step	Update epic progress table with new stage and progress percentage
RULE_EPIC_COMPLETION_01	All steps completed in epic	Update epic status to COMPLETED in registry and epic file
RULE_SUMMARY_01	Epic step completed	Prepend a one-sentence summary as a new list item under ## Changelog in project-config.mdc.

Step Stage Execution Checklist
âœ… Follow the current epic step requirements exactly. Do not deviate from plan unless approved.
âœ… Generate up-to-date, bug-free, high quality, modern fully functional code. Take time, don't rush
âœ… Run and pass all tests/linters.
âœ… Do not leak secrets; mask any credentials before logging.
âœ… Update epic progress tracking in designated update zones only.
âœ… Validate all step acceptance criteria before marking complete.

Stay disciplined: blueprint â†’ seek approval â†’ construct â†’ validate â†’ advance to next step.

Integration Rules
âœ… Consult .cursor/rules/rule-framework-v2/epic-lifecycle-rules.mdc for all epic lifecycle automation rules
âœ… Consult .cursor/rules/rule-framework-v2/epic-registry.mdc for current epic discovery and status tracking
âœ… Read specific epic file .cursor/rules/rule-framework-v2/epics/[EPIC_NAME].mdc for detailed step context
âœ… Consult .cursor/rules/rule-framework-v2/architecture/core/patterns.mdc for mandatory architectural patterns (Dual User ID, etc.)
âœ… Never modify epic goals, requirements, or acceptance criteria - only update designated progress tracking areas

Epic Work Execution Flow
1. User requests work on epic or specific step
2. Check epic-registry.mdc to identify current epic and step
3. Read specific epic file for step details and requirements  
4. Update epic progress table to show BLUEPRINT stage
5. Plan step execution following all requirements
6. Get user approval for blueprint
7. Execute CONSTRUCT stage following plan
8. Complete VALIDATE stage with quality checks
9. Update epic progress and advance to next step
